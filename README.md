# SRIF
Demo code of ACMMM 2022 "Quality Assessment of Image Super-Resolution: Balancing Deterministic and Statistical Fidelity"

A simple version of SRIF is SFSN which can be found in [[SFSN code]](https://github.com/weizhou-geek/SFSN) 

For SRIF, we adopt the pyramids computation from [[matlabPyrTools]](https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/matlabPyrTools)
